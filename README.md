# Theme Switcher

This is a simple Theme Switcher project built using React Context API. It allows users to toggle between Light Mode and Dark Mode while managing theme state globally. I built this project while learning the basics of state sharing, context management, and toggle functionality in React.

Features:-

1.Switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode.

2.Smooth toggle animation for theme change.

3.Simple, minimalistic design for easy understanding and learning.
