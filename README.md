# Theme Switcher

This is a simple Theme Switcher project built using React (or plain HTML/CSS/JS depending on your implementation). It allows users to toggle between light and dark themes with a single click.
I created this project while learning the basics of toggle functionality and how to dynamically change styles based on user interaction. It demonstrates a fundamental approach to enhancing user experience by providing theme customization.

Features:-
1.Switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode.
2.Smooth toggle animation for theme change.
3.Simple, minimalistic design for easy understanding and learning.
